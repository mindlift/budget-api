# budget-api
A basic budgeting tool API. This is currently a work-in-progress. 

I wanted to build a customizable tool for creating simple budgets quickly and decided to implement it in a REST API with a web-based client to follow.

The first stage of development is a working RESTful API that uses JSON web tokens for authentication/authorization. The primary goal is to have well-defined, intuitive data endpoints for clients to utilize.
